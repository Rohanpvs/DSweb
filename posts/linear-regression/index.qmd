# Introduction

Welcome to another exciting data science journey! In this blog post, we'll delve into the fascinating world of Linear Regression using R. Linear Regression is a powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Our objective is to predict outcomes and gain insights from our data.

## The Challenge

Imagine you have a dataset containing information about student performance. We are curious to explore whether there's a relationship between the number of hours a student studies and their exam scores. Can we use Linear Regression to predict scores based on study hours?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before we jump into the code, let's take a peek at our dataset and explore its characteristics.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Generate a synthetic dataset for illustration purposes
set.seed(123)
study_hours <- rnorm(100, mean = 25, sd = 5)
exam_scores <- 50 + 3 * study_hours + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 10)
study_data <- data.frame(study_hours, exam_scores)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(study_data)

# Visualize the relationship between study hours and exam scores
ggplot(study_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = exam_scores)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Study Hours and Exam Scores", x = "Study Hours", y = "Exam Scores")

# Build the Linear Regression model
linear_model <- lm(exam_scores ~ study_hours, data = study_data)

# Display the summary of the Linear Regression model
summary(linear_model)

# Create a scatter plot with the regression line
ggplot(study_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = exam_scores)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Study Hours vs Exam Scores", x = "Study Hours", y = "Exam Scores")
